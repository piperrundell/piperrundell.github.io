  <div> One day, the Little Blue Fish had an idea. “I will ask the Rainbow Fish for one of his scales. That way, we could have something in common and become friends.”
    <br> The Little Blue Fish followed the Rainbow Fish and called out, “Wait for me! Please give me one of your shiny scales. They are so wonderful, and you have so many.”
