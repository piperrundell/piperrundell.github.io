    <div> A long way out in the deep blue sea there lived a fish. Just an ordinary fish, smaller than the rest, the Little Blue Fish.</div>

    <div> The Little Blue Fish got along well with the other fish, but there was one special fish, the Rainbow Fish, who would never play with them.
      <br>The Little Blue fish wanted so badly to be friends with the Rainbow Fish, but the Little Blue Fish
      was too ordinary to impress the beautiful, shiny Rainbow Fish.
