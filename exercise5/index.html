  <h1> When I take you to the Valley, </h1> <br>
  <p> You’ll see the </p>
  <h4> blue hills </h4>
  <p>on the left and the </p>
  <h4> blue hills </h4>
  <p>on the right,<br>
    the rainbow and the vineyards under the rainbow late in the rainy season, <br>
    and maybe you’ll say, </p>
  <h3>“There it is, that’s it!”</h3>
  <p>But I’ll say. </p>
  <h3>“A little farther.”</h3>
  <p>We’ll go on,<br>
    I hope,<br>
    and you’ll see the roofs of the little towns and the hillsides yellow with wild oats,<br>
    a buzzard soaring and a woman singing by the shadows of a creek in the dry season,
    and maybe you’ll say,</p>
  <h3>“Let’s stop here, this is it!”</h3>
  <p>But I’ll say, </p>
  <h3>“A little farther yet.”</h3>
  <p>We’ll go on,
    and you’ll hear the quail calling on the mountain by the springs of the river,<br>
    and looking back you’ll see the river running downward through the wild hills behind,
    below, and you’ll say,</p>
  <h3>“Isn’t that the Valley?”</h3>
  <p>And all I will be able to say is,</p>
  <h3>“Drink this water of the spring, rest here awhile, we have a long way yet to go and I can’t go without you."</h3>
