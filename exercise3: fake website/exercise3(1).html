  <h2 style="color:#4CA8E6" id="About"> <em> About </em></h2>
  <p style="color:#347099"> CLIFF Monthly, founded in Boulder, CO, was the result of a rekindled friendship rooted in a passion for outdoor exploration. The founders, Chase Byers and Piper Rundell had crossed ski paths years ago before
                being reunited during their university years. Despite the amount of time that had passed the relationship was stronger than ever thanks to the mutualistic admiration for the great outdoors. We look forward to sharing this relationship
                with you. </p>
