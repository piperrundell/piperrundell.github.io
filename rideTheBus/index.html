      <div class="quote-text" id="js-quote-text"> Ride the bus is a fun card game in which you will go through four rounds of drawing cards. The goal is to get through all four rounds. <br>
      The first round you will attempt to guess whether the next card drawn will be either red or black. If you guess incorrectly, you try again, if you guess correctly, you move on. <br>
      The second round you will guess whether the next card drawn will be higher or lower than the previous. If you guess incorrectly, you try again, if you guess correctly, you move on. <br>
      With the two previous cards drawn, you will guess whether the next card will be outside, or in between the two. If you guess incorrectly, you try again, if you guess correctly, you move on. <br>
      The final round you must guess which suit the next card drawn will be. If you guess incorrectly, you try again, if you guess correctly, you move on. </div>
